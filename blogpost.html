      <h1>Very Real Short People Problems: </h1>
      <p>
        So that’s me, fairly handsome if I do say so myself, but short, very
        short. Statistically, I am in the 4th percentile for height in the USA,
        so in other words, 96% of American men are taller than me. In fact, 46%
        of American women are actually taller than me by the same analysis tool,
        so the whole short guys can’t get girls problem, appears to be a very
        real problem, if I let the whole height thing attack my confidence (but
        we’ll also get to that bit later). 
        I’ve attached a handy little heigh percentile chart thing so you can see 
        where you measure up and maybe
        give yourself a sort of ego boost… So, now to the whole life thing and
        growing up short… My parents aren’t exactly gigantic; in fact I actually
        tower over my mother who stands at a fabulous 5ft, so we all knew that
        unless I was a feat of nature, I wouldn’t grow up to be André the Giant.

        Now, when you’re the short kid in class, you have a choice, yes a
        choice, about how you want to live your life and there are some fairly
        unique options to choose from… 1. You become “that funny short kid,”
        (see Kevin Hart/Danny DeVito for reference) 2. You take yourself way too
        seriously and develop a case of Short Man Syndrome (This isn’t great for
        your relationships but can prove to make you successful, see Napoleon
        for reference). 3. You somehow become super cool and end up being the
        frontman for one of the biggest bands in the world (This is rare but
        happens, see Billie Joe Armstrong-Green Day for reference) 4. You spend
        every waking hour in the gym to compensate for your height, and end up
        slightly out of proportion (see Jose Raymond or your short friend who
        spends way too long in the gym for reference) 5. This is the slightly
        sad one, but being short affected your self confidence and you have
        anxieties about being enough/being loved and life feels harder as you
        blame your height on your problems in life. (Can’t really reference many
        famous people for this one) So these are the 5 most common options to
        choose from when you are rather short, and embarrassingly I have more or
        less rallied through all the options during my 17 years of life so far.

        Currently I stand somewhere between obsessing over the gym, occasionally
        being the funny short one when it comes to karaoke, and trying to build
        something by taking a growth mindset, educating myself and building
        connections that are completely independent of my height. Essentially
        I’m happy with my life right now, grateful for the immense number of
        opportunities I’ve had, but still somewhat anxious about my height.

        About a year ago, I fell into the fifth choice of how to live your life
        as a short person, which resulted in levels of nervousness around
        people, which I had never experienced before. There’s a consistent
        reminder in most media platforms that being short makes you somewhat
        inferior to the men around you, women prefer a big, husky man rather
        than a small, somewhat sensitive man, and there is a fair amount of
        pretty open and accepted discrimination to short men, without much
        challenge. In 2020, to discriminate people based on gender, orientation,
        race or weight is extremely frowned upon, and has sparked protests all
        over the world, but there has never been an uprising of shorter people,
        who protest their own discrimination. It would actually be pretty
        entertaining to witness a whole army of midgets marching through the
        streets of New York or London deserving to be treated equally, but alas,
        I doubt that will ever happen in my lifetime… In my opinion, the main
        reason for the lack of protest, and acceptance of discrimination has
        been that it is often a subject that can be easily glossed over and
        ignored. It almost seems like it is not a real problem and those who
        complain about their height are just acting as victims of their own
        mindset. The funny thing is, I actually agree with the above statement.

        To complain about your height, or feel unhappy about the cards you have
        been dealt in life, is a terrible mindset. We live in a planet where a
        Black Man feels scared to approach a White Policeman, a planet where
        conflict has devastated the lives of children before they can even get
        the chance to go to school, a planet where the basic human rights of
        people have been removed in dictator-ruled Countries, a planet where
        people have to struggle to obtain clean drinking water on a daily basis.

        As a 17 year old, growing up in a developed country, living a privileged
        life, it is rather easy to forget how easy our lives have become, and
        the craving to become a victim can easily slide back in. That isn’t to
        say, it is okay to openly discriminate people on their height, but it is
        me saying that if people are a little bit unfair on you, it really isn’t
        that deep. It took a long time for me to come out of the nervous shell
        associated with being short, and return to accepting myself, and loving
        myself as every human being should be able to. This is because it isn’t
        easy., The media will still be there, there will still be girls who
        won’t ever be interested in me based of my height, there will still be
        short jokes being made, there will still be a stigma that being short
        automatically causes me to have Short Man Syndrome, and there will still
        be the guys who make themselves feel better by making fun of the short
        one. This won’t ever change, I promise you. The only thing that you can
        change is how you perceive this, how you react to this and how you
        leverage your height to help you (as opposed to hindering yourself). 
        We are all dealt cards in life, some will be amazing, and some will be
        downright problematic, but the key to life, is using these cards,
        leveraging them and giving yourself a kick start in life, as well as
        refusing to be a victim in any situation. There have been days when I
        woke up and felt downright miserable about my body image, and other days
        when I woke up and felt like a King. We are human beings and it is
        natural to feel good some days, and terrible on other days (blame
        hormones for that ones), but pushing through is the true mark of
        confidence, and when you are at the stage, where you still feel happy in
        your own skin, despite discrimination, I’d say you’ve won at life.
